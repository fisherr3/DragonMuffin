        <h2>The Best Haiku You Have Ever Read</h2>
        <p>This poem was greatly inspired by the grading rubric for this website.  I think that the design requirements really pushed me to make something profound, and meaningful.</p>

        <h2>My Personal Interests</h2>
        <p>I am a connoisseur of chocolate covered wafers; Specifically the Kit Kat.  The Kit Kat is clearly the most advanced desert to ever grace this mortal realm.  The crunch of its wafer and the smoothness of its chocolate are far superior to all other sweets, even the left Twix.</p>
        <p>I have also mastered the skill of standing on rolly chairs.  When I have to reach a high shelf, I never have to get a stool or a step ladder.  I can even stand on the the arm rests of most wheeled chairs.</p>
        <p>Lastly I am the foremost expert at conveying incredulous information in a formal style.  I would even dare to state that I could write three whole paragraphs, without passing on any meaningful knowledge. Although that would require my utmost focus.</p>
